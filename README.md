<h2>Task 1- Converting two telemetry data formats into a single unified data format</h2>
This project was a part of <b>Deloitte Virtual Internship</b> program in collaboration with a japan based manufacturing company Daikibo. The task was to convert two telemetry data formats into a single unified data format.
<h3>Objective</h3>
1. Analyze two different telemetry data formats<br>
2. Identify all the common and unique fields of both the dataset with the provided unified format.<br> 
3. Convert two telemetry data formats into a single format.
<h3>Approach</h3>
1. Studied both the telemetry formats<br>
2. Mapped all the fields with the final dataset<br>
3. Designed a structure to get the desired output by using python libraries<br>
4.Validated the converted data.
<h3>Technologies used</h3>
Python and Python libraries<br>
1. json – for parsing and generating telemetry data<br>
2. datetime – for handling and standardizing timestamps<br>
3. unittest – for validating data transformation logic<br>
